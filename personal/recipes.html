<h2> Key Lime Pies </h2>
<ul>   
  <li> 2 9-inch store bought Graham Cracker Pie Crusts </li>
  <li> 3 Sweetened Condensed Milk (14 oz)   </li>
  <li> 12 egg yolks (like to Use egg whites for cocanut macroons) </li>  
  <li> 12 fluid oz of fresh squeezed lime juice  </li>
  <li> as much lime zest as desired  </li>
</ul>    
 
Combine sweetned consensed milk and the 12 egg yolks into large bowl and thoroughly mix with wisk.
Pour in the lime juice and zest and again throughly mix.  Pour filling into both pie tins and place
in a 350 degree Fahrenheit oven for 30 minutes.  Since ovens are so different from each other, I'd
recommend that you start looking at the pies every 5 minutes or so until the crust is golden brown
or the filling seems solid.  I once probably overcooked this pie but later discovered a wonderful 
caramel undertone.
    
I like to serve this pie on the cold or cool side. It freezes very well so I usually eat one right
away and freeze the other.
    
Notes:  
    
You can use bottled lime juice but the results will be vastly inferior.
  
The final pie mixture may seem a little "wet" and 12 ounces of lime juice may seem like alot but 
I think the results speak for themselves.
    
Actual Key Limes are quite small so I always use the larger "Persian" limes which I think
have more of a kick.  And a mechanical juice squeezer is very helpful. I cut each lime in half and
send each end through a hand held juicer that looks like a overgrown nut cracker.
    
The pie is not green because of the yellow egg yolks. Although the zest might help here.   
    

<h2> Carrot Cake </h2>
    
<ul>
  <li> 1 cup vegetable oil                   </li>
  <li> 2 cups Unbleached All-Purpose Flour   </li>
  <li> 2 cups sugar (can fresh ginger day before) </li>  
  <li> 3 cups finely grated carrots          </li>
  <li> 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans or walnuts  </li>  
  <li> 1 cup flaked coconut  (optional)      </li>
  <li> 4 large eggs                          </li>        
  <li> 1 teaspoon salt                       </li>    
  <li> 2 teaspoons baking soda               </li>       
  <li> 1 tablespoon cinnamon (optional)      </li>  
  <li> 1/2 teaspoon ginger   (optional)      </li>
  <li> 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves (optional) </li>
</ul>
<br>
Mix by hand in bowl.  (Don't need extra mess of a Stand Mixer)<br><br>

Don't need to grease pan.  Batter has enought oil in it. <br><br>

Pour and spread out in 9x13 pan.  Put in oven at 325 for 30 minutes <br>
and then start checking every 5 minutes until toothpick comes out clean.  <br>
All ovens are so different that this is intentionally vague.  <br>
