<h2> Carrot Cake </h2>
    
<p>
1 cup vegetable oil
2 cups sugar
1 teaspoon salt
4 large eggs
1 tablespoon cinnamon (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ginger   (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves   (optional)
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour
3 cups finely grated carrots
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans or walnuts
1 cup flaked coconut  (optional)

Don't need to grease pan.  Batter has enought oil in it.

Pour and spread out in 9x13 pan.  Put in oven at 325 for 30 minutes and then start checking 
every 5 minutes until toothpick comes out clean.  All ovens are so different that this is
intentionally vague.
