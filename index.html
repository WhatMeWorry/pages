<h2> A file URI takes the form of </h2>

<h2> <em> file://host/path/to/file/index.html </em> </h2>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does this differ with? </p>

<p> Rather than having to constantly push and pull from github after each change, open locally to
    file:///c: and navigate to the work in progress.  </p> 

    
    
    
    
<p> For a network location:

file://hostname/path/to/the%20file.txt
Or for a local file, the hostname is omitted, but the slash is not (note the third slash):

    file:///c:/path/to/the%20file.txt  </p>    
    
<p> When you see “%20,” it represents a space in an encoded URL, for example,http://www.example.com/products%20and%20services.html. </p>

I don't think it's immediately obvious how to make a new folder in the GitHub repository from the web browser interface.

Fortunately, it's super easy. Actually, it's just the same as creating a new file.

The only caveat is that you can't create an empty folder. So you are going to have to make a file to go in your new directory, even if you subsequently delete this file.

<h2> How to take screenshot of the current active window </h2>   
<p>  <b> Alt + Print Screen </b>
To take a quick screenshot of the active window, use the keyboard shortcut <b> Alt + PrtScn </b>. This will copy your currently active window to the clipboard. You will need to paste the screen shot into an image editor and then save it to the desired format. </p>
