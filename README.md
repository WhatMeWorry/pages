website project dedicated to supporting the learning and adoption of the D language and modern OpenGL (4.0 or greater).

This project exists for several reasons. Primarily to make the best modern OpenGL (4.0+) tutorial possible while using the D Programming Language. I consider D the best general-purpose systems-level computer language period. Additionally, I confess to living some of my late adolescent and early adulthood before the age of the Internet. Naturely, I have never really mastered HTML5 or CSS3. I hope to rectify this deficiency herewith.

I have been working/playing with pre-OpenGL 3.0 and had created some interesting things. But I always felt there was some gaps in my knowledge.  With the major design changes in OpenGL 3.0 and above, I had to learn many new things. Now, I finally thought it was time to draw a line in the sand and master these nagging questions. Picking OpengL versin 4.0 was logical since both it and the earlier 3.0 versions have been around long enough to be mainstream. Most people will have this pre-installed on their computers. 

I have been meaning to learn HTML and CSS for years. I finally bit the bullet and dived in mainly because I suddenly realized I could host here a web site (for free) on GitHub itself.  Additionally, I can't recommned enough a book entitled "Learning Web Design - A beginner's guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics - 5th edition" by Jennifer Niederst Robbins.  With this book opened on my desk and your browser at this site, you can pretty much teach yourself. Whenever, I need clarification about something, I'd go to https://www.w3schools.com/html/  The "Try it Yourself" button was particular helpful sandbox to play in.

Lastly, I'd like to thank a fellow github project, https://github.com/p0nce/d-idioms , which I found enlightening because of its clear and elegant syntax. Many random websites had such complicated programming that learning HTML and CSS was almost impossible.
