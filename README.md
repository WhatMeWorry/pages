project dedicated to my github web site.

This project for two primary reasons, to make the best modern OpenGL (4.0+) tutorial possible, and to teach myself HTML5 and CSS3.

I have been meaning to learn HTML and CSS for years. I finally bit the bullet and just dived in mainly because of I suddenly realized I could host here a web site on GitHub itself.  I can't recommned enough a book entitled "Learning Web Design - A beginner's guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics - 5th edition" by Jennifer Niederst Robbins.  With this book opened on my desk and my browser at this site, I pretty much taught myself. Whenever, I need clarification about something, I'd go to https://www.w3schools.com/html/  The "Try it Yourself" button was particular helpful with many concepts.

Lastly, I'd like to thank a fellow github project, https://github.com/p0nce/d-idioms , which I found enlightening because of its clear and elegant syntax. Many random websites had such complicated programming that learning HTML and CSS was almost impossible.
