project dedicated to my github web site.

This project exists for two primary reasons, to make the best modern OpenGL (4.0+) introduction possible, and to teach myself HTML5 and CSS3.

I have been working/playing with pre-OpenGL 3.0 and had created some interesting things. But I always felt there was some gaps in my knowledge.  With the major design changes in OpenGL 3.0 and above, I had to learn many new things. Now, I finally thought it was time to draw a line in the sand and master these nagging questions. Picking OpengL versin 4.0 was natural enough since both it and the 3.0 versions have been around long enough to be mainstream. 

I have been meaning to learn HTML and CSS for years. I finally bit the bullet and dived in mainly because I suddenly realized I could host here a web site (for free) on GitHub itself.  Additionally, I can't recommned enough a book entitled "Learning Web Design - A beginner's guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics - 5th edition" by Jennifer Niederst Robbins.  With this book opened on my desk and your browser at this site, you can pretty much teach yourself. Whenever, I need clarification about something, I'd go to https://www.w3schools.com/html/  The "Try it Yourself" button was particular helpful with many concepts.

Lastly, I'd like to thank a fellow github project, https://github.com/p0nce/d-idioms , which I found enlightening because of its clear and elegant syntax. Many random websites had such complicated programming that learning HTML and CSS was almost impossible.
